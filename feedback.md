| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Direct manipulation implementation (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | The direct manipulation works but there has to be a little bit of a penalty to how derivative this is of the sample code. Only the axis had to change from the original sample, and in fairness to other students who implemented more wide-ranging differences, a small “ease of implementation” deduction needs to be taken off. We do this one-time so you aren’t in “double jeopardy” for the other point categories. | 8 | One-time “ease of implementation” deduction because the submitted component entailed very little work coming from the sample code |
| **Notification mechanism (callback/event) (_2b_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Notifier includes `$current` as `this`, then `currentAngle` and `newAngle`…just as with the sample code. But you’ve been deducted for that already so we give full credit here. | 20 |  |
| **Plugin model implementation (_2b_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | `data(‘swivel-angle’)` works well for the model…just as it did with the sample code. The difference here is that the swivel is along the _x_-axis instead of _y_. | 20 |  |
| **Web front end integration (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Integration is unfinished. The files are there, the plugin is installed, but the callback is no different from the sample code and not even an equivalent element (for logging) was added to the web front end, much less any information that is appropriately controlled by a vertical swivel component. Note that this deduction is outside of the one-time “ease of implementation” deduction because integration is a distinct task that is independent of the plugin itself. | 8 | Unfinished and buggy integration work (not even a logging element was added to the HTML) |
| **Inappropriate third-party library use** | No third-party contraband found. |  |  |
| **Test Suite (_4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 6 out of 6—Nicely done, but as stated, the amount of actual work was reduced here because the plugin is _very_ derivative of the sample code: just a change of axis. <br><br>**Statements** 18/18 (100.00%)<br>**Branches** 10/10 (100.00%)<br>**Functions** 2/2 (100.00%)<br>**Lines** 18/18 (100.00%) | 20 | 
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | No errors. |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 10 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **76** | **Total** |
